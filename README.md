# ERC20 Token and Vault Contract

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for an ERC20 token and a vault contract. The ERC20 token implements the standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, while the vault contract provides enhanced security features for managing and storing ERC20 tokens.

## ERC20 Token Contract

The ERC20 token contract adheres to the ERC20 standard interface, providing functionalities for creating, transferring, and managing fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Key features of the ERC20 token contract include:

- **Token Creation**: Users can create tokens with a specified initial supply.
- **Token Transfer**: Allows transfer of tokens between addresses.
- **Token Approval**: Implements the approval mechanism for delegated token transfers.
- **Token Allowance**: Enables querying the amount of tokens that a spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of the token owner.

## Vault Contract

The vault contract offers additional security features for managing ERC20 tokens, including multi-signature authorization and time-locked withdrawals. Key functionalities of the vault contract include:

- **Token Deposit**: Users can deposit ERC20 tokens into the vault.
- **Multi-Signature Authorization**: Requires multiple parties to authorize token withdrawals, enhancing security.
- **Time-Locked Withdrawals**: Provides the option to lock token withdrawals for a specified duration.
- **Emergency Withdrawal**: Allows authorized parties to withdraw tokens in case of emergencies.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the ERC20 token and vault contracts are welcome. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
